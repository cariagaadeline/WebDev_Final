I apologize for the disorganization.
INSTRUCTION: 

signin.php is the main connection to proceed to the dashboard.
It's found in pages folder - search - signin.php
USERNAME: admin
PASSWORD: 12345

There are errors in the directories to which I was not able to access it
even though the lines of codes are correct.

After logging in, the system will lead you to the dashboard, and it will 
show you the history of the admin's inputted data, and in the side bar, there
are some of the connections that is required for the system.

So, for the full functionality, after you click on the rooms for example,
after you click from the rooms to another connections, it will occur an error,
so you really have to go back to the dashboard and click another connections
so that it will function still. 

P.S This is the error, it says that the directory does not exist even though
it's correct.

How to solve it?
